      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I'm Veronica, a student, fitness enthusiast and runner. I wasn't born a runner or an
	  athlete in high school, I was the girl in the gym class walking the mile run. At age 21, I 
	  started going to the gym, mainly for aesthetic reasons. Some years after I became very 
	  interested in health and fitness, I was focusing on becoming the healthiest version of
	  myself. During the pandemic, when gyms closed, I did what a lot of people did and started
	  running. I went from not even being able to run half a mile, despite having downloaded 
	  couch to 5k a decade ago. Somehow, I persevered and ran my first half marathon. Then I 
	  back tracked and ran my first 10k then 5k (I know, its backwards). Since then, I have done a
	  handful of races and became a certified nutritionist through NASM.  </p>
